/*
Given pointers to the heads of two sorted linked lists, merge them into a single, sorted linked list.
Either head pointer may be null, meaning that the corresponding list is empty.

Example
headA refers to 1 - 3 - 7 - null
headB refers to 1 - 2 - null
A & B both are references to the head of a list
The new list is 1 - 1 -2 - 3 - 7 - null

Returns SinglyLinkedListNode pointer: a reference to the head of the merged list
